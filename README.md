## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my **Raspberry Pi Projects** repository.

This repo contains all of my Raspberry Pi builds, experiments, dashboards, automation systems, AI integrations, and hardware-based projects.

I focus on building real-world systems by combining:

- 🔌 Hardware + Software  
- 🌐 Backend + Frontend  
- 🤖 Edge AI & Local LLM experiments  
- 📡 IoT + Arduino integrations  
- 📷 Camera streaming systems  
- 📊 System monitoring tools  

---

## 🧠 Development Hardware (IMPORTANT)

⚠️ All projects are developed and tested on:

- **Model:** Raspberry Pi 5  
- **RAM:** 16GB LPDDR4X  
- **Cooling:** Official Active Cooler (Fan + Heatsink)  
- **OS:** Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)  
- **Storage:** High-speed microSD / SSD (project dependent)

> Some projects may require the higher RAM and improved CPU architecture of Raspberry Pi 5.  
> Running them on older boards (Pi 3 / Pi 4 lower RAM variants) may cause performance limitations.

Make sure you are using **Raspberry Pi 5**.  
Older boards may look similar but do not offer the same performance or features.
